# OBBDetection

**note**: If you have questions or good suggestions, feel free to propose issues and contact me.

## introduction


[BboxToolkit](https://github.com/jbwang1997/BboxToolkit) is developed to support oriented bounding boxes operations, which is heavily depended on by this toolbox.

## License

This project is released under the [Apache 2.0 license](LICENSE).


## Installation

Please refer to [install.md](docs/install.md) for installation and dataset preparation.

## Get Started

### Oriented models training and testing

If you want to train or test a oriented model, please refer to [oriented_model_starting.md](docs/oriented_model_starting.md).

### How to use MMDetection

If you are not familiar with MMdetection, please see [getting_started.md](docs/getting_started.md) for the basic usage of MMDetection. There are also tutorials for [finetuning models](docs/tutorials/finetune.md), [adding new dataset](docs/tutorials/new_dataset.md), [designing data pipeline](docs/tutorials/data_pipeline.md), and [adding new modules](docs/tutorials/new_modules.md).

## Acknowledgement

It is also refered [S2ANet](https://github.com/csuhan/s2anet) and [AerialDetection](https://github.com/dingjiansw101/AerialDetection) when develping OBBDetection.

This toolbox is modified from [MMdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection).
